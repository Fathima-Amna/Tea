                    <p>Sitting in the shadow of the lush greenery of Pidurutalagala, 3km east of Nuwara Eliya, Pedro Tea Estate was established on the very spot that James Taylor planted his first tea bushes and kick-started the Ceylon tea industry. Established in 1885, the factory was under British ownership until it was nationalised in 1975, before being reprivatised just a decade later. Despite its plantations and tea fields being less picturesque than others, it is one of the most easily accessible estates in the hill country and the 20-minute long tours take you through the entire manufacturing process, from grading to packaging, where you will see plenty of pieces of colonial-era equipment that is still in operation.

                    <p>The expansive Damro Labookellie Tea Estate, set in 5000 acres or gorgeous rolling hillside 20km north of Nuwara Eliya, is much more scenic than Pedro Tea Estate with the surrounding countryside feeling much more unblemished and unspoilt. The factory was originally part of the MAckwoods conglomerate, founded in 1841 and nowadays contains a rather modern and visitor centre complete with a café where you can sample the estate’s teas. Due to its easy to each location on the main road between Kandy and Nuwara Eliya, the factory can become busy during the high season but the brief free tour gives a good overview of the production process.

                    <p>The name Lipton is now synonymous with tea worldwide, but the Lipton empire had humble beginnings in Ceylon. In 1890, James Lipton stopped at the island en-route to Australia where he purchased a number of small, failing tea plantations in order to cut out the middleman in the burgeoning tea business that eventually grew into a global empire. Of all his plantations, he held Dambatenne in the highest regard.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>The factory can still be found between Haputale and Bandarawela, equidistant from both. While many of the tea factories around Sri Lanka have modernised, the slightly disheveled Dambatenne site still produces tea much the same as it did when it was first built in 1890, with the old machinery and process remaining unchanged for 130 years. Tours are available, however, there is no tea for sale on-site. If you want to see the whole factory in operation, it is best to arrive before noon.

                    <p>Tours take place every day except Mondays and the day after public holidays since there is no tea plucking on Sundays.

                    <p>Located in Ramboda, 20km north of Nuwara Eliya on the road to Kandy, Blue Field Tea Garden was founded in 1921 is known for its high grown tea that it produces on its 193-acre site situated 1285 meters above sea level in the misty mountains. It’s estimated that Blue Field produces around 30,000 kg of tea each month. Although the tours of the factory are short, they are professional and highly informative if not as in-depth as others on offer around the island. However, the onsite restaurant is worth a visit if you are passing on your way to or from Nuwara Eliya and visitors are free to wander the surrounding terraces and watch the tea pluckers at work.
